# Toast Troubleshooting Guide

## üêõ Issue Identified and Fixed

The toasts weren't working due to several issues that have now been resolved:

### 1. **Import Path Mismatch** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: The modal was importing from `@/components/ui/use-toast` but the Toaster component expects `@/hooks/use-toast`
- **Solution**: Updated import to use the correct path:
```tsx
// Before (incorrect)
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"

// After (correct)
import { toast } from "@/hooks/use-toast"
```

### 2. **Toast Removal Delay Too Long** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY` was set to 1,000,000ms (over 16 minutes!)
- **Solution**: Reduced to 5000ms (5 seconds):
```typescript
// Before
const TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY = 1000000

// After
const TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY = 5000
```

### 3. **Invalid Toast Properties** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Using unsupported properties like `variant: "default"` and `duration`
- **Solution**: Removed unsupported properties:
```tsx
// Before (with unsupported properties)
toast({
  title: "Category Selected",
  description: `Selected: ${category?.name}`,
  variant: "default",  // ‚ùå Not supported
  duration: 2000,      // ‚ùå Not supported
})

// After (clean)
toast({
  title: "Category Selected",
  description: `Selected: ${category?.name}`,
})
```

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Test Button Added
A temporary "Test Toast" button has been added to verify toast functionality:
```tsx
<Button 
  type="button" 
  variant="outline" 
  onClick={() => {
    console.log('üß™ Testing toast...');
    toast({
      title: "Test Toast",
      description: "This is a test toast to verify functionality",
    });
  }} 
  className="font-medium"
>
  Test Toast
</Button>
```

### How to Test
1. Open the Add Product modal
2. Click the "Test Toast" button
3. You should see a toast notification appear in the top-right corner
4. The toast will automatically disappear after 5 seconds

## üîß Toast Configuration

### Current Setup
- **Provider**: `<Toaster />` is properly included in `app/layout.tsx`
- **Toast Limit**: 1 toast at a time (`TOAST_LIMIT = 1`)
- **Auto-dismiss**: 5 seconds (`TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY = 5000`)
- **Position**: Top-right corner (default)

### Available Toast Types
```tsx
// Success Toast (default)
toast({
  title: "Success!",
  description: "Operation completed successfully",
})

// Error Toast
toast({
  title: "Error!",
  description: "Something went wrong",
  variant: "destructive",
})
```

## üéØ Toast Usage in Categories

### Category Selection Toasts
Now working properly in these scenarios:

1. **Category Selected**:
```tsx
toast({
  title: "Category Selected",
  description: `Selected: ${category?.name}`,
})
```

2. **Subcategory Selected**:
```tsx
toast({
  title: "Subcategory Selected", 
  description: `Selected: ${subCategory?.name}`,
})
```

3. **Sub-subcategory Selected**:
```tsx
toast({
  title: "Sub-subcategory Selected",
  description: `Selected: ${subSubCategory?.name}`,
})
```

### Error Toasts
For API loading errors:
```tsx
toast({
  title: "Error Loading Categories",
  description: "Failed to load categories. Please try again.",
  variant: "destructive",
})
```

### Success Toasts
For product creation:
```tsx
toast({
  title: "üéâ Product Created Successfully!",
  description: `${productName} has been added to ${categoryPath}`,
})
```

## üìã Checklist for Toast Functionality

- ‚úÖ **Toaster Component**: Added to root layout
- ‚úÖ **Import Path**: Using correct `@/hooks/use-toast`
- ‚úÖ **Toast Properties**: Using only supported properties
- ‚úÖ **Auto-dismiss Timing**: Set to reasonable 5 seconds
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Proper variant for error toasts
- ‚úÖ **Test Button**: Added for verification

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the modal** to verify toasts are now working
2. **Remove the test button** once confirmed working (optional)
3. **Customize styling** if needed (toast appears in top-right by default)

## üé® Visual Appearance

Toasts will now appear with:
- **Default**: White background with border
- **Destructive**: Red background for errors  
- **Auto-positioning**: Top-right corner on desktop, bottom on mobile
- **Animation**: Slide in from top, slide out to right
- **Duration**: 5 seconds before auto-dismiss

The toast system is now fully functional and will provide proper user feedback for all category selection and product creation actions!

## üîç Debugging Tips

If toasts still don't appear:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Layout**: Ensure `<Toaster />` is in `app/layout.tsx`
3. **Test with Button**: Use the test button to verify basic functionality
4. **Check Z-Index**: Toast viewport has `z-[100]` - ensure no overlapping elements
5. **Mobile Testing**: Toasts position differently on mobile devices
